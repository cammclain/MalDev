Evasion Techniques for Havoc Demon in Red Team Operations
Introduction: Red team operators often employ evasion techniques to deploy and operate agents like the Havoc Framework’s Demon implant without triggering security defenses. Havoc’s Demon agent is an open-source post-exploitation implant comparable to Cobalt Strike’s Beacon, but by default it is not heavily obfuscated or stealthy​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
. Instead, operators must integrate their own evasion methods to avoid antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) detection. Below, we analyze several categories of evasion strategies – from initial-stage droppers and packers to code tweaks and runtime tricks – all in the context of ethical hacking and adversarial simulation. Each technique’s effectiveness, trade-offs, and operational security considerations are discussed in line with industry best practices.
1. Droppers: Initial Access and Execution Strategies
Custom Dropper Methodologies: A dropper is a lightweight loader or stager used to deliver the Demon payload onto a target system. Rather than directly writing the full Demon binary to disk (which AV might scan and flag), a dropper often uses a multi-stage approach. For example, a phishing attack might first deliver a benign-looking file (e.g. a document or HTML) that triggers a small malicious script or program – the dropper – on the target. This dropper’s job is to fetch or assemble the real Demon implant in memory and execute it. In one documented case, an initial ZIP contained a .scr screensaver file acting as a downloader; when run, it decrypted and wrote a Batch script to the Temp folder and executed it, ultimately loading the Havoc Demon agent​
CRITICALSTART.COM
. Using staged delivery like this helps evade defenses by splitting the malware across steps and time. Each stage can also be customized (e.g. using different file types or programming languages) to blend into the environment and avoid known malware signatures.Process Injection Techniques: Custom droppers often perform process injection to run the Demon implant within the memory of a legitimate process, hiding its execution. Process injection involves allocating memory in a remote process, writing the payload into that memory, then starting a new thread to execute it​
INJASEC.COM
​
INJASEC.COM
. Common injection methods include: CreateRemoteThread (writing shellcode into another process and creating a thread there)​
INJASEC.COM
​
INJASEC.COM
, process hollowing (starting a benign process in suspended state, replacing its code with the payload, then resuming it), APC injection (queuing the payload to execute during an Asynchronous Procedure Call in a target process), and others. The goal is to make malicious code run under the context of an existing trusted process (like notepad.exe or another system process) so that security tools see only a legitimate process running, not a new suspicious process. This can evade simple process-based monitoring and whitelisting defenses​
INJASEC.COM
. For instance, an APT attack was observed using DLL sideloading as a dropper technique: a legitimate executable was planted alongside a malicious propsys.dll; when the EXE ran, it loaded the malicious DLL, which decrypted and executed the Havoc Demon payload in memory​
CYFIRMA.COM
. By injecting Demon via a trusted host process or DLL sideload, the dropper masks the malware’s presence.Sandbox Evasion Strategies: Advanced droppers also include checks to avoid running in analyst sandboxes or virtual machines. Malware sandboxes are automated analysis environments that execute files to observe behavior – droppers try to detect these and stall or exit to prevent detection of the payload. Common sandbox evasion techniques include: environment and timing checks, and logic bombs. For example, the dropper might check the machine’s hostname or username for known sandbox indicators (like “WIN-” prefixes or names like HAL9TH used by Windows Defender sandbox)​
INJASEC.COM
. It may also look for running processes associated with analysis tools or virtualization (e.g. VMware or VirtualBox processes) and abort if found​
INJASEC.COM
. Time-based evasion is another tactic – e.g. sleeping for an extended duration or calling a huge number of benign API calls (“API hammering”) to waste time​
INJASEC.COM
. Sandboxes often have short execution timeouts, so a dropper that sleeps for 10+ minutes or performs delays might outlast the analysis window. Droppers can also call non-standard APIs or undocumented system calls that sandbox environments fail to emulate​
INJASEC.COM
. In practice, many droppers combine multiple checks: one Havoc attack’s PowerShell stage explicitly checked if it was running in a sandbox before proceeding to download the next payload​
THEHACKERNEWS.COM
. If the environment looked suspicious, the dropper would not continue to deploy the Demon. By baking in such safeguards, red teamers ensure their Demon implant only executes on real target machines during engagements, not in sandbox detonation chambers.
2. Crypters and Packers: Obfuscating the Payload
Once the dropper or loader is ready to deliver Demon, evading static detection by antivirus is crucial. This is where crypters and packers come in. A crypter typically encrypts or encodes the Demon payload and bundles it with a small decryption stub. When executed, the stub decrypts the real payload (in memory or on disk) and launches it. This encryption masks the byte patterns of the malware so scanners cannot recognize known signatures​
INJASEC.COM
. Common schemes include AES or RC4 encryption, simple XOR obfuscation with a key, or even formatting shellcode bytes as benign-looking data (e.g. UUIDs or MAC addresses)​
INJASEC.COM
. These techniques distort the malware’s form without changing its functionality. For example, one technique is to XOR-encrypt the Demon shellcode and only decrypt it at runtime; until that moment, the blob of data doesn’t resemble malicious code, so static scanners are unlikely to flag it.A packer is a program (or method) that compresses and/or encrypts an executable, often with the ability to unpack itself in memory. Packers not only conceal byte signatures but also often scramble the structure of the file. There are many packers (UPX is a well-known one) – however, off-the-shelf packers can themselves become IOC signatures (security products may recognize a UPX-packed file even if the payload is unknown). Modern red teams therefore use more advanced or custom packers like PEzor or Nim-based packers. These open-source tools envelop shellcode or PE files with layers of obfuscation and often integrate other evasion tricks (like clearing hooks or spoofing a legit certificate) to make the output fully undetectable (“FUD”)​
FINDREAM.GITHUB.IO
​
FINDREAM.GITHUB.IO
. For instance, PEzor is a shellcode/PE packer that can remove certain userland API hooks and employ direct syscalls to bypass AV/EDR interception​
FINDREAM.GITHUB.IO
. Another tool, Optiv’s ScareCrow, generates encrypted loaders that patch AMSI/ETW and even fake a code signing signature to appear legitimate​
ASSUME-BREACH.MEDIUM.COM
. Using such packers, operators can take a Demon binary or shellcode and transform it into a completely new artifact with high entropy and no recognizable patterns. This greatly reduces detection by signature-based engines.Heuristic Bypass Considerations: Crypters and packers primarily defeat signature-based detection, but modern AV also use heuristic analysis. One challenge is that strongly encrypted payloads have high entropy (they look like random data), which can itself appear suspicious to some heuristic scanners. Attackers mitigate this by adding benign content or using compression formats that produce more normal-looking entropy distribution. They might also avoid packing the entire payload; for example, some packers encrypt only sections of the binary or use multi-stage decryption to avoid a large uniform blob of ciphertext that might alarm heuristic engines. The key is to strike a balance – enough obfuscation to hide known Demon signatures, but not so much as to trip “generic suspicious” rules. When done properly, encryption/packing can allow a malicious payload to sit on disk without immediate flagging. In one case study, after implementing custom packing and encryption, a malware sample evaded all 40 tested AV engines during a static scan​
INJASEC.COM
. However, as we’ll discuss, this doesn’t mean it evades behavioral detection once it runs.
3. Modifying Demon Source Code for Evasion
Because Havoc Demon is open source, red teamers can modify its code directly to create a unique variant that security tools won’t recognize. This is a powerful advantage for evasion – defenders might have YARA rules or heuristics tailored to the public Demon, but a customized build can break those detections.Static Signature Evasion via Code Changes: One target for modification is any unique constant or algorithm in Demon that a defender might key off. For example, the Demon agent uses a specific hashing algorithm (a modified DJB2 hash) to resolve API function addresses at runtime​
CRITICALSTART.COM
. Researchers have shown that you can detect Demon implants by scanning for the bytes of this hashing routine in the binary​
JAIMINTON.COM
. By tweaking the algorithm – e.g. using a different hash function or altering the constants – an operator can evade those YARA rules without affecting Demon’s functionality. Similarly, the Demon code contains identifiable strings and function names (like DemonInit, the agent’s entry point). Renaming or obfuscating these markers in the source (and in the compiled output) will thwart static signature matches. Essentially, since Demon was “not designed to play the cat-and-mouse game” with AV​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
, it’s up to the red team to refactor or morph the code as needed: change class names, reorder execution flows, insert junk code, and compile with different settings. These changes yield a payload with the same capabilities but a unique footprint – a technique akin to attackers rebranding malware. In fact, threat actors have been observed doing this: one campaign used a modified Havoc Demon DLL that still had core Demon functionality but with custom communication routines​
THEHACKERNEWS.COM
. By hiding each stage behind trusted services (Microsoft Graph API/SharePoint in that case) and altering the C2 protocol in the source, the operators obscured the malware’s network signatures​
THEHACKERNEWS.COM
.Evading Behavioral Detection: Beyond static signatures, source modifications can also help with behavioral evasion. If there are known “noisy” behaviors in Demon’s default workflow, a red team can modify or remove them. For example, Demon might normally perform certain system surveys (enumerating processes, querying Windows API) upon initial beacon that could trigger EDR alerts. An operator could disable those routines or add logic to do them more stealthily (e.g. delayed execution or only on specific command). Another example is indirect syscalls: the stock Demon already supports using syscalls instead of normal API calls for some operations​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
. If this isn’t enabled by default, an operator could toggle it or even extend it, ensuring that Demon makes system calls in an unhooked manner (thus evading userland API hooks, as discussed below). Likewise, an operator could integrate an AMSI bypass into Demon’s initialization if they plan to execute any script or PowerShell code through it – patching AmsiScanBuffer in the source code at start would preempt AV from scanning any PowerShell run via Demon. All these require touching Demon’s source, but yield a stealthier implant tailored for the engagement. The trade-off is the need to carefully test the custom build to ensure stability (no crashes or logic errors were introduced) and to maintain these changes over new Havoc releases. Done well, source modifications produce a “homemade” Demon that slips past defenses that would catch the vanilla implant.
4. Alternative Evasion Strategies at Runtime
Even after the payload is delivered and executed, a red teamer can employ numerous in-memory evasion techniques to remain undetected. These focus on defeating live monitoring and analysis by EDR solutions.
In-Memory Execution & Fileless Techniques: Running the Demon agent purely in memory (without a visible file on disk) is a fundamental evasion tactic. Memory-only execution denies traditional file-scanning AV a chance to analyze the payload before it runs​
LMGSECURITY.COM
. Havoc Demon is often delivered as shellcode or a reflectively loaded DLL for this reason. For instance, a loader might decrypt shellcode and execute it directly with a call like CreateThreadpoolWait, which allocates and runs the shellcode in one go​
CRITICALSTART.COM
. Another loader, “KaynLdr,” was noted to load the Havoc Demon DLL from memory without the usual DOS/NT headers present, so that even if an EDR scans process memory, it won’t easily recognize a PE file signature​
CRITICALSTART.COM
. This kind of reflective loading (sometimes called PE-less or headerless loading) makes the agent look like just anonymous mapped memory rather than a module, helping it evade memory scanners. The fileless approach extends to using trusted systems as components – e.g. one campaign loaded a Python interpreter (pythonw.exe) into memory via PowerShell, then used it to run the Demon agent, all to blend in as legitimate processes​
THEHACKERNEWS.COM
.
AMSI Bypasses: If the operation involves running any script (PowerShell, .NET, VBS) or even loading certain binaries, the Windows Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) can expose the malicious code to AV engines. Bypassing AMSI is therefore common. One simple method is patching the AMSI DLL in memory – e.g. replacing the first bytes of AmsiScanBuffer with a RET instruction – so that any scan calls immediately succeed without scanning. This can be done by the dropper or the Demon agent early in execution​
FINDREAM.GITHUB.IO
. Another “patchless” technique is to hijack AMSI’s initialization so it never properly activates​
CN-SEC.COM
. Many public red-team tools (like Cobalt Strike’s Beacon or ScareCrow loaders) automatically perform an AMSI bypass on launch, and a custom Demon loader can do the same. The result is that any subsequent malicious code (e.g. reflective assembly load or PowerShell command) is not inspected by AV, significantly reducing chances of detection during execution.
ETW Unhooking: Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a mechanism that EDRs and security tools use to get telemetry from user-mode applications (like .NET and others). Malware can disable or tamper with ETW to reduce logging. A known technique is patching the function EtwEventWrite (which user-mode code calls to publish ETW events) to simply return immediately. The Havoc Demon’s loader in one case patched EtwEventWrite in Ntdll.dll, effectively blinding any ETW-based monitoring​
CRITICALSTART.COM
. By doing so, it prevented the EDR from receiving event logs about subsequent behavior. This is an aggressive but effective evasion: once ETW is knocked out, a large class of sensors (like some antivirus AMSI providers and telemetry collectors) lose visibility. Red teams may incorporate ETW patching in their implant’s startup routine, but should be aware that some EDRs detect ETW patching itself as malicious (since legitimate software rarely does this). An alternative is more surgical unhooking – some packers will unhook only specific security vendor hooks (in Ntdll or Kernel32 functions) rather than blind all ETW. Unhooking can be done by restoring the original bytes of hooked functions in user-land (if the EDR hasn’t guarded them). Demon’s built-in Indirect Syscall capability is another way to implicitly bypass hooks: by invoking syscalls directly, it avoids calling the hooked API functions at all​
INJASEC.COM
.
Direct/Indirect Syscalls: Modern EDRs often rely on user-mode API hooks (see next section) to intercept suspicious calls like VirtualAllocEx, NtProtectVirtualMemory, CreateProcess, etc.​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. By using direct syscalls, malware can execute the system call instruction (syscall) to request kernel services without going through the hooked DLL function. Havoc Demon can be configured to use indirect syscalls (via a stub from a different unmonitored function) for its Windows API calls​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
. Tools like SysWhispers or Hell’s Gate can dynamically generate syscall wrappers for any Windows API, allowing the agent to perform actions (memory allocation, injection, etc.) in a way that bypasses user-mode hooks​
INJASEC.COM
. The net effect is that the EDR’s monitoring thread never gets alerted to the API call, because the call didn’t use the normal hooked entry point. This significantly hinders detection, though kernel-level monitoring (or heuristic detection of unusual call patterns) could still catch on. In practice, combining syscalls with things like return-address spoofing (so the call stack looks legitimate) further improves evasion – Demon even includes options for return address stack spoofing during sleep​
CRITICALSTART.COM
.
Userland API Hooking/Hook Evading: Some implants go as far as manipulating the hooks themselves. One strategy is to detect if functions have been hooked by an EDR (by scanning the prologue bytes for a jump opcode) and then either unhook (restore the original bytes from disk image) or use alternative invocation (e.g. call an equivalent function or use a lower-level technique). Userland API hooking by EDRs means any call to, say, NtOpenProcess actually jumps to the EDR’s code first​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. Malware authors have responded by writing their own hooked API implementations. For instance, instead of calling the hooked CreateRemoteThread, an implant might manually implement the thread creation with NtCreateThreadEx via syscall, or queue an APC to a thread – avoiding the hook. Some sophisticated malware even hooks APIs before the EDR does, by injecting very early (in the loader stage) or patching the hook function to point somewhere benign. For red teamers, the common approach is typically to unhook dangerous APIs on the fly (for example, restore Ntdll.dll to its clean state in memory after the EDR has hooked it). This can be done by copying a fresh, uninstrumented copy of the DLL from disk into memory and swapping function pointers – techniques used by open-source tools like FreshyCalls or Module Stomping. Unhooking removes the EDR’s eyes from critical APIs, enabling the Demon agent to perform privileged actions (like code injection, credential dumping, etc.) without being immediately intercepted.
In summary, after the Demon is running, techniques like in-memory only execution, AMSI/ETW disarming, and hook evasion ensure the agent can carry out post-exploitation tasks stealthily. Red team operators will often layer multiple such techniques to handle different defenses – for example, using direct syscalls to avoid hooks and encrypting the agent’s memory during idle periods (sleep encryption) to thwart memory scans​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
. Each added trick makes analysis and detection exponentially harder for the blue team.
5. Detection Mechanisms in Modern Windows Environments
To appreciate these evasion tactics, it’s important to understand how modern AV/EDR products detect threats on Windows. Signature-based detection (matching known bad byte patterns, file hashes, or heuristics) is still used by traditional antivirus. However, standalone signature scanning is increasingly ineffective because attackers proliferate obfuscation techniques that easily alter those patterns​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. As a result, modern endpoint protection leans heavily on behavioral and heuristic analysis – monitoring what a process does in real time and judging maliciousness from context​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
.User-Mode API Hooking (EDR Sensors): A principal way EDRs watch behavior is by installing hooks in common API functions​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. When an EDR is installed, it injects code into running processes (often via a kernel driver or DLL) that patches functions like NtAllocateVirtualMemory, NtWriteVirtualMemory, CreateProcessW, etc. The patch typically overwrites the first bytes of the function with a jump to the EDR’s monitoring code​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. Thus, whenever any program calls that API, control is diverted to the EDR, which can inspect the arguments and decide whether to allow it, log it, or block it​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. For example, if a process tries to allocate RWX memory and write shellcode (typical of injection), the EDR sees the sequence via its hooks and can flag or stop it. EDRs maintain extensive hook coverage over sensitive APIs in Ntdll, Kernel32, WinInet, etc., giving them visibility into most actions that malware would perform. Additionally, EDR drivers can monitor system calls at the kernel level, tracking events like process creation, module loading, or registry changes. Many EDRs correlate events – for instance, a process that spawns a script interpreter and then that interpreter spawns rundll32 to execute code might trigger an alert due to an anomalous process tree.Memory Scanning and Indicators: Beyond hooking, some AV/EDR solutions do periodic memory scans of processes. Windows Defender ATP, for example, can scan process memory for fragments of known malware (even if fileless). If a Demon agent’s shellcode is in memory and contains patterns from a known variant, it could be detected. This is why techniques like encrypting the agent in memory while it sleeps (using those Ekko/Foliage techniques) are useful – they reduce the static footprint in RAM. EDRs also make use of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and other telemetry. They subscribe to system events (via ETW providers for process creation, module loads, network connections, etc.) and feed that into cloud analytics or local machine learning models. Modern cloud-based EDR might flag “beaconing” behavior if a process connects to an IP at precise intervals, or might use anomaly detection to spot a process that suddenly starts dumping LSASS memory. Windows also provides AMSI, which sends script content to the AV engine – this is how default Defender can catch malicious PowerShell commands (unless bypassed). In short, defenders have a toolbox of monitoring mechanisms: static analysis, userland hooks, kernel callbacks, ETW events, AMSI scanning, and even hypervisor-based trapping (in some advanced solutions) that watches for specific CPU instructions sequences common in shellcode.Bypassing vs. Alerting: Given these defenses, an attacker (or red teamer) must bypass as many as possible to avoid detection. It’s worth noting the difference between traditional AV and modern EDR here. Traditional AV might simply quarantine a file if it matches a signature; if our evasion (encryption/packing) is good, we avoid that and the dropper executes. However, an EDR might let the unknown program run but will kill or isolate it when behavior turns malicious. For example, our packed Demon loader might not be flagged on disk at all – but the moment it tries to inject into another process or phones home, the EDR’s behavior analysis springs into action. This dynamic emphasis is why evasion must consider more than just static signatures. Testing has shown that with sufficient obfuscation, malware can evade dozens of AV engines on VirusTotal, yet still get caught by a few EDR engines that run the code in sandbox or instrumented environments​
INJASEC.COM
​
INJASEC.COM
. Red team operators often test payloads in lab VMs with solutions like Defender, CrowdStrike, etc., to see if their evasion holds up in a realistic detection scenario, not just a static scan.Finally, defenders also use log analysis and anomaly detection on the host and network. Even if an implant doesn’t get outright blocked, it might raise subtle indicators: strange parent-child process relations, odd strings in command arguments, or failed connection attempts to known malicious domains. Threat hunting teams often look for these breadcrumbs. A good red teamer will therefore also employ operational security (OPSEC) measures in choosing how Demon behaves (e.g. using a common Windows user-agent string for C2 traffic, matching beacon intervals to normal network patterns, etc.) to avoid tipping off attentive defenders.
6. Comparative Effectiveness and Operational Considerations
No single evasion technique is a silver bullet; each has pros and cons. Red teams choose techniques that align with their engagement’s goals and rules of engagement, balancing stealth against complexity and reliability. Below is a breakdown of each approach discussed, with its strengths, weaknesses, and OPSEC considerations:
Droppers & Process Injection: Pros: Allows staging of the payload in smaller, more benign steps. A well-crafted dropper can appear harmless (or be nested in a user-opened document or trusted process) to get initial execution. Injection into a legitimate process can hide the malicious thread among normal activity, defeating simple process-based detection​
INJASEC.COM
. Cons: Multi-stage deployments add complexity – each stage is a point of failure if detected. Injecting into the wrong process can cause crashes or noticeable instability. Aggressive injection (hollowing critical processes or misusing Windows utilities) might trigger heuristic alarms or leave forensic evidence. OPSEC: Use processes that make sense for the scenario (e.g. don’t inject into calc.exe if it’s not usually running). Clean up or roll back any changes (like spawned processes or written files). Ensure the dropper quits or self-deletes to reduce artifact presence.
Crypters & Packers: Pros: Effective at bypassing static file scanners – often essential for getting the payload onto disk and executed without immediate flag​
INJASEC.COM
. Automated packers can integrate multiple evasion tricks (encryption, junk code, fake signatures, etc.) in one go. Rapid to apply and tweak (try a different crypter if one gets detected). Cons: If overused, can create new fingerprints – e.g. a custom packer that becomes notorious will itself be flagged. Highly encrypted payloads may look suspicious or get heuristically flagged by ML models for abnormal characteristics. Also, once the payload decrypts in memory, it’s “live” and may be caught by behavior-based tools, meaning packers alone aren’t enough for EDRs​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. OPSEC: Avoid public or pirated crypters from untrusted sources (they might embed backdoors). Test each packed build against up-to-date defenses. Be cautious of packers that disable OS security features in a noisy way (some packers turn off AMSI or disable Windows Defender services – this might succeed in labs but on a real protected network it’s a glaring red flag).
Modifying Source Code: Pros: Yields a unique variant – very effective against signature and hash-based detection. You control exactly what the payload does, allowing removal of known bad patterns and addition of custom evasion. Can change network indicators (domains, C2 protocol) to blend in, as seen when attackers used Graph API to make C2 traffic look like normal cloud API calls​
THEHACKERNEWS.COM
. Harder for blue teams to attribute or use threat intel against a one-off custom Demon build. Cons: Requires programming skill and time. Mistakes in modification can crash the implant or degrade its functionality (a risk during a time-sensitive engagement). Maintaining a custom fork of Demon means you don’t automatically get upstream fixes or features. OPSEC: Document your changes and thoroughly test in a safe environment to ensure stability. Consider implementing selectable evasion features via config so you can turn them on/off as needed. Keep the modifications subtle – overly complex obfuscation can sometimes backfire if a defender manually analyzes the binary and notices it’s trying very hard to hide (raising suspicion even if they can’t immediately flag it).
In-Memory & Runtime Evasion (AMSI/ETW/Syscalls/Unhooking): Pros: These techniques directly target the weak points of EDR’s defense mechanisms. In-memory fileless execution sidesteps disk scans​
LMGSECURITY.COM
; AMSI and ETW bypasses cut off two major feedback channels to AV/EDR​
CRITICALSTART.COM
; direct syscalls render many user-mode hooks ineffective​
PWNEDCOFFEE.COM
. When combined, they can allow an implant to operate for long periods on a host without triggering automated defenses. Cons: Implementing them can be complex and sometimes version-specific (e.g. syscalls numbers differ between Windows builds, so hard-coding them or using outdated SysWhispers stubs could fail or crash). There’s also a cat-and-mouse element – if an EDR vendor detects an implant unhooking its hooks or patching AMSI, it may respond by terminating the process as a self-defense measure. These actions can also be noisy if not done carefully (for example, some older AMSI bypass techniques became well-known and now cause alerts on their own). OPSEC: Use the latest evasion techniques sparingly and only as needed – for instance, patch AMSI right before executing a PowerShell script, not far in advance. That way, any anti-tamper defenses trigger as close to your real action as possible (reducing the defender’s time to respond). When using direct syscalls, prefer an established library that handles variability and doesn’t itself contain obvious signatures. Monitor the target system’s stability; if unhooking functions, ensure those functions won’t be legitimately needed later by the program (unhooking too broadly could inadvertently disable needed functionality or crash the process).
Understanding Detection (The Defender’s POV): The most effective evasion approaches are those designed with knowledge of how the specific target defenses work. For example, if you know the target uses Microsoft Defender with Cloud Protection, you might avoid making any unusual network connections or executing code that would trigger a cloud check (since that could lead to a quick signature update during your operation). If the target uses an EDR that heavily relies on userland hooks, leaning on direct syscalls and memory encryption is wise. Conversely, if the target has kernel-based monitoring, you might focus on blending in behaviorally (sticking to approved binaries and scripts to execute your payload). Always consider Operational Security: any evasion step that fails or is detected can blow the engagement’s cover. Sometimes the simplest approach is best – e.g. using a valid code-signing certificate for your payload (to appear trusted) and just doing basic obfuscation might raise fewer flags than an overly elaborate stunt like spawning a rogue svchost with hollowing. Red teams simulate adversaries, and real threat actors often “live off the land” to avoid leaving fingerprints. In practice, combining moderate packing, a well-chosen dropper technique, and a couple of selective in-memory patches (AMSI/ETW) can be enough to evade most defenses without resorting to overly esoteric tricks.
Conclusion: In an age of advanced defense, evasion in red team ops is about stacking techniques – each countering a different detection layer – while maintaining reliability. The Havoc Demon implant gives a flexible foundation that operators can tailor with custom loaders, packers, and code tweaks​
HAVOCFRAMEWORK.COM
. By using droppers and crypters to get in, and then altering behavior in memory, a red team can quietly operate in a target environment for the duration of an engagement, providing realistic simulation of modern threat actors. Importantly, all these activities are conducted under rules of engagement and are tightly controlled – the goal is to help organizations improve by identifying gaps in their detection and response. Employing these evasion techniques ethically ensures that blue teams can develop and test their capabilities against stealthy adversary behaviors, ultimately strengthening the organization’s security posture.References: All information and examples above are drawn from industry research and documented techniques in ethical hacking contexts, including malware analyses of Havoc in the wild and recommended red team practices​
