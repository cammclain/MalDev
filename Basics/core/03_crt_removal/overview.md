# Module: CRT Library Removal

> **Prerequisite:**  
> Completion of the **Malware Compiling** and **File Entropy Reduction** modules.  
> Understanding the role of a freestanding binary and custom entry points in Zig v0.13.0.

## Overview

The C Runtime (CRT) library provides standard functionalities for C programs. However, in malware development, CRT dependencies can increase the binary's size and reveal common signatures associated with benign applications. **CRT Library Removal** focuses on eliminating these dependencies, resulting in:

- **Smaller Binary Size:**  
  Removing the CRT results in leaner binaries.

- **Reduced Signature Footprint:**  
  Less recognizable CRT code reduces the chance of detection by heuristic scanners.

- **Greater Control:**  
  A freestanding binary gives you full control over initialization and resource management.

## Techniques for Removing CRT Dependencies

### 1. Building Freestanding Binaries

- **Freestanding Environment:**  
  When you write a binary as freestanding, you bypass the typical CRT initialization routines. This requires you to manage the entry point and any needed runtime setup manually.

### 2. Custom Entry Points

- **Directly Defining `main`:**  
  By defining your own entry point using `pub export fn main() callconv(.C) void`, you ensure that the compiler does not include CRT startup code.

### 3. Compiler and Linker Flags

- **Optimized Build:**  
  Use Zig's build commands to minimize extraneous code and data. Combined with file entropy reduction techniques, this further obscures the binary.

## Example: Creating a CRT-Free Binary in Zig v0.13.0

The following example builds upon our minimal binary from the previous module, ensuring that no CRT dependencies are linked into the final executable.

### Source Code (`crt_free.zig`)

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Define a custom entry point for a freestanding Windows binary.
// This bypasses the CRT startup routines.
pub export fn main() callconv(.C) void {
    // Insert your payload or initialization code here.
    return;
}
