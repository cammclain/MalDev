# Mythic C2 Framework

## Overview

Mythic is a powerful and flexible Command and Control (C2) framework designed for red team operations and adversary simulations. It stands out for its modular architecture, allowing for the use of custom agents, C2 profiles, and payloads across a variety of platforms and languages. This directory serves as a resource for learning how to develop, deploy, and manage Mythic agents, understand its operational capabilities, and explore advanced techniques for evading detection and maintaining persistence.

## Getting Started with Mythic

### Installation

Before diving into agent development, you'll need to set up the Mythic C2 framework. Here are the general steps:

1. Clone the Mythic repository from its official GitHub page.
2. Follow the installation instructions detailed in the Mythic documentation. This usually involves running a setup script and configuring the initial settings.
3. Verify the installation by accessing the Mythic web interface through the URL provided at the end of the setup process.

### First Steps

- **Familiarize Yourself:** Explore the Mythic web interface, understand the basic components like agents, payloads, and tasks.
- **Hello World Agent:** Start by deploying a simple agent to ensure your environment is correctly set up. The documentation provides a basic agent example for this purpose.

## Directory Structure

This directory contains resources and examples tailored for learning how to integrate and develop with the Mythic framework effectively. Here's what you'll find:

- **Agents/**: Contains examples and templates for developing Mythic agents. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific agent or technique, complete with its own README for detailed instructions and insights.
- **README.md**: You are here! This document serves as your guide to navigating the Mythic section of this repository.

## Development Best Practices

When developing with Mythic, consider the following best practices to enhance your agents' effectiveness and stealth:

- **Modularity:** Design your agents to be modular, allowing for easy updates and the addition of new functionalities.
- **Operational Security (OpSec):** Always prioritize operational security. Implement techniques to avoid detection, such as encrypting communications and using stealthy persistence methods.
- **Testing:** Rigorously test your agents in controlled environments before deployment to ensure they behave as expected without unintended side effects.
