# MalDev
My repo for learning Malware Development


This is a huge work in progress. I'm not sure how useful it will be to others, but at the time of writing this, my goal is to break down the skills I learn that fall (even remotely) into the category of Malware development, and turn each of these skills into a blog post + demo code.

My long term goal is to work on a red team, specifically working with malware.


There's likely to be many empty readme's and folders as some of this is here as a placeholder to make sure I come back to it later. 


Also, obligitory disclaimer that you should not do crime and breaking the law is not good and shit.
