## `randomProcessArray.nim`

For this one, I created a function that will select a random process to inject into from an array

Honestly, not sure what I was on with this, I think the thought process was, "Add random function == control flow obfuscation" which is.... embarassing. 

But I'm going to leave it in here, because the idea may be useful for something one day.
