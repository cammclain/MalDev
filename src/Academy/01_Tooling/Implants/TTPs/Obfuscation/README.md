### Obfuscation Techniques

1. **String Obfuscation**: Avoid using plain-text strings, especially for sensitive information or system commands. Encrypt strings or use algorithms to generate them dynamically.
    
2. **Control Flow Obfuscation**: Alter the program's control flow to make it harder to understand the logic, without changing what the program does. This can be achieved through techniques like bogus conditional statements, opaque predicates, or reordering blocks of code.
    
3. **Binary Packing**: Use packers or encrypt the entire payload. Only decrypt it in memory when it's time to execute.
    
4. **Code Encryption**: Encrypt sections of code and decrypt them at runtime. This is a step further than binary packing and can be more targeted.
    
5. **Polymorphism**: Change the binary every time it's distributed, without changing its functionality. This can be achieved through automatic code generation techniques or by integrating a polymorphic engine.
