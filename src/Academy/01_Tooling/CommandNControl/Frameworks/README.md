# Command and Control Frameworks

This section is dedicated to the various C2 frameworks I've or used at some point.

> Note: Not all of these are traditional "C2" frameworks, some are just collections of scripts that I've used to automate various tasks, but I've also included some notes on stuff like [Gophish](https://github.com/gophish/gophish) and [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework).
